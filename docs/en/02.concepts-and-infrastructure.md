# Concepts

Damocles contains a series of abstractions and functional components. Understanding these will help us comprehend how Damocles operates.

## Public Section

### ActorID

`ActorID` is the identifier format for SPs used in Damocles components. It is an integer and corresponds to the number part of the SP's ID address.

For example:

- In the testnet, an SP ID address `t01234` corresponds to an `ActorID` of `1234`.
- In the mainnet, an SP ID address `f02468` corresponds to an `ActorID` of `2468`.



We used a unified identifier format like 'ActorID' to 

- Ensure convenience in recognition and writing
- Avoid confusion that may be caused by network identifiers (`t`, `f`) and type identifiers (`0` in `t0`) in addresses



### objstore

`objstore` is a storage infrastructure abstraction based on object storage patterns.

We know that, in Filecoin, the various actions that interact with data use filesystem-based storage facilities extensively. In practice, we find that other than some relatively basic data access patterns, many features provided by the file system are not used.

Through analysis, we believe:

1. In many scenarios, basic object storage abstractions can already meet the needs of Filecoin.
2. Whether building local large-scale, high-availability distributed storage clusters or using existing commercialized storage solutions, object storage has many options.
3. Existing filesystem-based storage can be interacted with using the object storage interfaces through a simple proxy layer.



Of course, at the algorithm level, since some key processes still do not support abstractions based on object storage (for example `MerkleStore`), we currently only convert the file system to object storage. We hope that in the future, through community promotion of native support for object storage in Filecoin at the algorithm level, users will be able to choose or even mix suitable storage solutions according to their own needs.



### piece store

`piece store` is a storage abstraction used in storage deal sealing scenarios to access the `piece` data of deals.

The `piece` data here refers to the original raw data content issued by the user, without padding and FR32 conversion.

Since `damocles-cluster` is not involved in writing `piece` data, it only provides an interface for reading data.



## damocles-worker section

### sealing store

The `sealing store` is a storage facility on the same machine as `damocles-worker`, used to temporarily store data files generated during the sector sealing process. It is typically composed of high-performance local storage devices (such as `nvme`).

The `sealing store` always fulfills that 

- Each sector uniquely corresponds to a single `sealing store`
- One `sealing store` will only contain one sector at any given time.

Each `sealing store` contains the subdirectories `meta` and `data`, which store the state and sealing data of the sector in progress, respectively. 

This ensures that sector states do not interfere with each other across multiple `sealing store`. Even if some of a `sealing store`'s underlying storage devices fail, the impact is limited to the `sealing store` the devices contain.

Typically, `sealing store` is planned according to the available storage resources on the current host machine.



### Remote store

The `remote store` is the permanent storage facility for sector data, typically a storage cluster.

In `damocles-worker`, the `remote store` is currently implemented as an object storage interface over the filesystem.

Sector data sealed and awaiting to be put on chain will be moved from the `sealing store` to the `remote store`.

In fact, the `remote store` is more relative to the local `sealing store`. Both the `damocles-manager` and `damocles-worker` need to access this storage infrastructure.



### processor

The `processor` is the executor of the sector sealing steps. Typically, each independent step corresponds to a type of `processor`, such as the `pc1 processor`, `c2 processor`, etc. Users can configure the amount of instances allowed to operate parallely for each type of processor.

Usually, `processor` is planned according to the available computational resources on the current host machine.



##### External processor

The `external processor` is a special type of `processor` that exists as a subprocess. Through a defined protocol, it interacts with the main process to exchange task context and executes a specific sealing step.



The `external processor` enables Damocles to leverage the OS interfaces to configure and isolate computational resources for subprocesses, such as 

- Specifying `cpu sets` for the `pc1 processor` via `cgroup` to keep sectors in the `pc1` phase from  competing for CPU resource.
- Specifying memory allocation preference for the `pc1 processor` via `numa` to reduce memory access latency in the `pc1` phase and improve cache prefetch efficiency in `multicore_sdr` mode.
- Binding unique available GPUs and separating lock files for multiple `c2 processor` via Nvidia's default GPU-related environment variables



In addition to convenient configuration and isolation of computation resources, `external processor` also enables **non-generic or non-public executor** implementations. Any executable program meeting the context interaction protocol can be integrated into the sealing workflow as an `external processor` implementation. This facilitates easy integration of options such as

- Highly customized `c2 processor`
- GPU outsourced `pc2 processor` or `c2 processor`

Users can freely choose various customized `external processors` for combination, unconstrained by who develops and maintains the specific `external processor`.



#### Relationship between sealing store, processor, and sector

In the previous sections, we mentioned that `sealing store` and `processor` are planned separately based on storage and compute resources respectively. Does this mean that they don't need to maintain a 1:1 ratio?

The answer is yes, for the following reasons:

At any given stage, the resources that a `sector` occupies are the combination of computation resources (`processor`) and storage resources (`sealing store`).

In the sealing workflow, when a sector transitions from one stage to the next, it releases the compute resources it previously occupied, and `damocles-worker` tries to acquire compute resources needed for the next stage. The released compute resources can be readily allocated to other waiting sectors.



For example,

typically, considering costs and hardware specs, the number of available `sealing stores` is often much higher than the number of available `p1 processors`. In the sealing process, the `p1 processor` released from a sector that finished the `p1` stage computation can be used for waiting sectors on other `sealing stores`. This enables high-density utilization of hardware resources.



## damocles-manager section

### Basic service API

These are services that Damocles relies upon and definitions of interfaces.

These services and interfaces provide `damocles` with basic capabilities to interact with the chain and other participants.



#### chain.API

This is a set of chain-related interface definitions defined in `venus/venus-shared`. It mainly provides Damocles with basic chain service interfaces.



#### messager.API

This is a set of message-related interface definitions defined in `venus/venus-shared`. It mainly provides Damocles with basic capabilities for sending messages, checking message confirmation, and getting contract execution results.



#### market.API

This is a set of storage deal related interface definitions defined in `venus/venus-shared`. It mainly provides Damocles with basic capabilities for deal allocation and obtaining deal data.



### RandomnessAPI

This is a simple encapsulation for `chain.API`, mainly used to provide random number information needed for sector sealing and maintaining.

This layer of encapsulation allows `damocles-worker` and other modules to simply obtain the needed results based on use, without having to worry about the underlying request objects (Drand or Filecoin) or formats.



### MinerInfoAPI

This is an encapsulation for `chain.API`, mainly providing information on SP granularity.



### SectorManager

This is a module that manages sector allocation. It is mainly responsible for assigning sector numbers based on the parameters passed by `damocles-worker`.

It can support multiple SPs and different sector sizes.



### DealManager

This module manages deals. It is mainly responsible for assigning deal `pieces` that can fit into empty allocated sectors, as well as releasing deals in failed sectors.



### CommitmentManager

This is the module for submitting sector messages onto chain. It is mainly responsible for submitting `PreCommit` and `ProveCommit` messages individually or in aggregate based on predefined strategies and observing the results of the submission.

### SectorStateManager

This module manages the state of sectors in progress. It receives status and exception updates from `damocles-worker`.

### SectorIndexer

This module manages the location of completed sectors. It is mainly responsible for locating specified sectors, commonly used during `PoSt` computation.
